a)
Enzyme: Selected from Uniprot- 
Advanced search 150-250 residue, enzyme, organism: homo sapiens
UniProtKB - P30041 (PRDX6_HUMAN)
Peroxiredoxin-6
Gene:PRDX6

b)
Model is from template: 5b6m.1 
Swissmodel: 










 

Phyre2:

 


c) PROSA: To analyze the quality of model:
 


Z score is -7.67 it means it’s below the average
Swiss model Qmean to analyze the quality of the model:
 

d) Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are antioxidant enzyme family. It’s function is as H2O2 hunters but also sensitive H2O2 sensors and signal transducers. Prxs play roles in various diseases. Prxs can be hyperoxidized to the sulfinic acid forms in the presence of high concentrations of H2O2.  Prx is changed accompanying oxidation states in oligomerization and attached to the function. Prxs in mammals, Prx6 is the only 1-Cys Prx. Beside some 2-Cys Prxs it can be found in all organs in humans and is present in all species from bacteria to humans. Prx6 has Ca(2+) independent phospholipase A2 activity. Though only the crystal structure of Prx in the oxidized state has been reported. 
e) There were no mutations to this template.
I changed a code and using swiss model, made a model of it.
The new sequence: (instead of leucine-L I used glutamic acid-E)
